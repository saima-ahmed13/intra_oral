Project Goal:
 To transform QA test data from an Excel source file into an interactive Pass/Fail summary report — while maintaining the exact format the client provided, and delivering the final output as a PDF document.
✅ Key Highlights:
·       Designed a dynamic Power BI report replicating the original test format.
·       Automated Pass/Fail test result visualizations for different QA parameters.
·       Enabled the client to review and export interactive reports to PDF format on demand.
·       Improved report accuracy, efficiency, and user experience without altering their workflow.
Another great example of how Power BI can adapt to niche, regulated healthcare environments while simplifying QA reporting!
